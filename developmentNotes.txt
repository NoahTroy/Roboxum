Notes for future improvements/ideas:
- Add different template options. I.E. one that gives a wordlist, one that gives a name/date field, one that provides lines for people to write-down the words that they've found, etc.
- Allow an answer key to be generated.
- Add a puzzle generation progress bar (wait to see if this is realistic... i.e. if puzzle generation actually ends-up taking a while or not).
- Add the ability to save puzzles previously generated for future printing/saving.
- Add the ability to generate puzzles with random words from the dictionary (or a custom dictionary) for fun, random gameplay.

Notes for development:
MAKE SURE TO RESET THE GLOBAL VARIABLES, OR TERMINATE THE CODE AFTER GENERATING THE BOARDS, OTHERWISE ERRORS WILL HAPPEN!
